## Project Workflow / Steps

### 1. Data Loading (Python)

* Imported raw dataset using Pandas
* Verified schema, data types, and structure

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA / PDA)

* Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, std)
* Distribution analysis
* Outlier and missing value detection

### 3. Data Cleaning

* Handled missing values
* Removed duplicates
* Renamed and created new columns
* Dropped irrelevant fields

### 4. Feature Engineering

* Created derived columns for analysis
* Prepared data for modeling and reporting

### 5. SQL Operations (MySQL Workbench)

* Created database and tables
* Inserted cleaned data
* Executed SQL queries:

  * SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY
  * ORDER BY, HAVING
  * Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

### 6. Model & Score Checking (Basic Analytics)

* Applied simple analytical models (e.g., Linear Regression)
* Evaluated results using model score

### 7. Power BI Dashboard

* Connected SQL / cleaned dataset to Power BI
* Built interactive visuals:

  * Sales trends
  * Customer behavior insights
  * Category-wise performance
* Used slicers and filters for interactivity

### 8. Reporting

* Created a structured project report
* Included problem statement, methodology, insights, and conclusions

### 9. Presentation (Gamma)

* Converted project insights into a professional PPT
* Used visuals, charts, and key findings for stakeholder presentation
